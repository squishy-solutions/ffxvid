	  readlink will follow the full path in case the input
	  is a symlink which may result of encoding files we
	  were not asked to
	* Don't print cropped resolution during runtime
	  if batch mode is selected
	* Remove check for realpath. It is now required and not
	  optional

2017-06-14 - ffxvid 1.1.7
	* Make software scaler tweaking optional
	* Added support for the unsharp filter for sharpen/blur
	* Use a colon symbol as separation for input/output color range

2017-06-13 - ffxvid 1.1.6
	* Bugfix in the video_colorspace_func() function. Wrong value

	* Merge the bicubic and spline scaler tuning code
	* Mention for the Lanczos scaler that the scaler
	  tuning value is the filter length and not sharpness
